                    Whether it's at school or university,
                    the one thing no own ever teaches you is how to teach yourself.
                    We often just end up drilling specific exercises and mindlessly
                    memorizing information sso that when exam time comes around, we pass
                    the test. But once the test is over, that information has outlived
                    its usefulness,s and there's no guarantee that information will be
                    retained. In the end, we're really just learning how to pass our tests.

                    Here's the real question:</span> does this approach of repetition and
                    memorization help us truly understand the subject material?
                    The academic consensus nowadays is that it doesn't. In fact, what's
                    more important than any individual topic is knowing how to study, but
                    for some reason, this point is often overlooked.
                    So, what can we do to remedy this?

            Barbara Oakleyâ€™s story.

              <p class="two-columns__paragraph">
                Math didn't come naturally to Barbara in childhood. She thought of herself as more of a humanities person,
                and not a brilliant one at that. With an eye to becoming a linguist,
                after school she enlisted in the army,
                who sent her to learn Russian. After several years of service, during which she rose to the rank of Captain, Barbara left the army and decided to study engineering.
                In was during this time that she developed her learning methodology as she was forced to reprogram her brain for a different kind of learning. It turns out that
                when something doesn't come naturally to you, having to work hard to gain the knowledge that other people may get at first glance gives you a deeper,
                more comprehensive understanding of the subject matter.
